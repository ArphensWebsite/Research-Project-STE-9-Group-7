    <h1>A Comparative Study of <i>Calamansi</i> (<i>Citrus microcarpa</i>) Extract versus Chili (<i>Capsicum  annuum</i>) Extract as Organic Pesticides</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>

    <h3>Background of the Study</h3>

    <p>In recent years, more people have started using organic farming, which has created a need for safe pest control methods that do not harm the environment or people. Among the natural resources available in the Philippines, <i>Calamansi</i> (<i>Citrus microcarpa</i>) and Chili (<i>Capsicum  annuum</i>) have been traditionally used in various applications, including as organic pesticides. But, a comparison of their effectiveness in managing pests, specifically in crops such as snap beans (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), has yet to be researched</p/>
    <p>Previous studies have explored the individual pesticidal properties of Calamansi and Chili extracts. For example, research has demonstrated that Calamansi extract possesses insecticidal properties due to its high citric acid content, which acts as a natural deterrent to pests (Cordero et al., 2021). Similarly, Chili extract is known for its capsaicin, a compound that has been proven effective in repelling and killing various types of insects (Dayan & Duke, 2019).</p>

    <p>This research seeks to compare the efficacy of <i>Calamansi</i> and Chili extracts as organic pesticides on snap bean plants. By determining which extract is more effective, this study aims to contribute to the development of eco-friendly pest control strategies that can be applied in sustainable agriculture.</p>

    <h3>Statement of the Problem</h3>

    <p>This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of <i>Calamansi</i> extract and Chili extract as organic pesticides in controlling pests that affect snap bean plants.</p>

    <p>Specifically, it seeks to answer the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the mortality rate of pests when snap bean plants are treated with <i>Calamansi</i> extract using:</li>
        <h4><li>Pure Calamansi extract</li></h4>
        <h4><li>75% Calamansi extract</li></h4>
        <h4><li>25% Calamansi extract</li></h4>
        <h4><li>What is the mortality rate of pests when snap bean plants are treated with Chili extract using:</li></h4>
        <h4><li>Pure Chili extract</li></h4>
        <h4><li>75% Chili extract</li></h4>
        <h4><li>50% Chili extract</li></h4>
        <h4><li>25% Chili extract</li></h4>
        <li>Is there a significant difference between <i>Calamansi</i> and Chili extract on the mortality rate of pests on snap bean plants?</li>
        <h4><li>Pure Calamansi Extract & Pure Chili Extract</li></h4>
        <h4><li>75% Calamansi Extract & 75% Chili Extract</li></h4>
<h4><li>50% Calamansi Extract & 50% Chili Extract</li></h4> 
<h4><li>25% Calamansi Extraxt % 25% Chili Extract</li></h4>        
    </ul>
