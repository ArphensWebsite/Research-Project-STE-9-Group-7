    <h1>A Comparative Study of <i>Calamansi</i> (<i>Citrus microcarpa</i>) Extract versus Chili (<i>Capsicum  annuum</i>) Extract as Organic Pesticides</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>

    <h3>Background of the Study</h3>

    <p>In recent years, more people have started using organic farming, which has created a need for safe pest control methods that do not harm the environment or people. Among the natural resources available in the Philippines, <i>Calamansi</i> (<i>Citrus microcarpa</i>) and Chili (<i>Capsicum  annuum</i>) have been traditionally used in various applications, including as organic pesticides. But, a comparison of their effectiveness in managing pests, specifically in crops such as snap beans (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), has yet to be researched</p/>
    <p>Previous studies have explored the individual pesticidal properties of Calamansi and Chili extracts. For example, research has demonstrated that Calamansi extract possesses insecticidal properties due to its high citric acid content, which acts as a natural deterrent to pests (Muhammad & Iqrar, 2021). Similarly, Chili extract is known for its capsaicin, a compound that has been proven effective in repelling and killing various types of insects.</p>

    <p>This research seeks to compare the efficacy of <i>Calamansi</i> and Chili extracts as organic pesticides on snap bean plants. By determining which extract is more effective, this study aims to contribute to the development of eco-friendly pest control strategies that can be applied in agriculture.</p>

    <h3>Statement of the Problem</h3>

    <p>This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of <i>Calamansi</i> extract and Chili extract as organic pesticides in controlling pests that affect snap bean plants.</p>

    <p>Specifically, it seeks to answer the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the mortality rate of pests when snap bean plants are treated with <i>Calamansi</i> extract?</li>
        <li>What is the mortality rate of pests when snap bean plants are treated with <i>Chili</i> extract?</li>  
        <li>Does the concentration of the extract affect tne mortality rate of pests on snap beans?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hypotheses</h3>
    <h4><ol>
        <li>There are no significant differences between the pesticidal properties of calamansi and chili extracts.</li>
        <li>There is a significant differences between the pesticidal properties of calamansi and chili extracts.</li>
    </ol></h4>
    <h3>Definition of Terms </h3>
    <h4><ul>
        <li>Calamansi<i>Citrus microcarpa</i> Extract: The liquid obtained from pressing the fruit of the Citrus microcarpa plant, known for its pesticidal properties due to its high content of essential oils.</li>
<li>Chili<i>Capsicum annuum</i> Extract: The liquid obtained from pressing the fruit of the Capsicum annuum plant, containing capsaicin, which acts as a natural deterrent to pests.</li>
    </ul>
        <h3>Significance of the Study</h3>
        <h4><p>This study is important because it helps us learn how natural things like Calamansi and chili can be used to protect plants from bugs without using harmful chemicals. By understanding how these natural extracts work as pesticides, farmers can keep their crops healthy in a way that's safe for the environment and for people. This could lead to healthier food and a cleaner planet!</p></h4>
        <h3>Scope and Delimitation</h3>
        <h4><p>In this study, we are focusing on two natural substances, Calamansi and chili, to see how well they can protect plants from bugs. We are only testing these two, and we will only look at how they work on certain types of bugs. We will do our experiments in a special setup to make sure everything is fair and accurate. We won't be looking at any other ways these plants might be useful, just their ability to keep plants safe from pests.</p></h4>
