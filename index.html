<h1><strong>A Comparative study of Citrus extracts (<i>Dalandan and Calamansi</i/>) versus Lemongrass and Chili extract as Organic Pesticides: Effects on Plant Health of Snap Beans (<i>Common Beans</i>) and Pest Repellence</strong></h1>
<body>

<h1>Chapter One: Introduction</h1>

<h2>1.1 Background of the Study</h2>
<p>As people become more aware of the dangers of chemical pesticides, there is a growing interest in using natural, organic alternatives in farming. Organic pesticides come from natural sources and are considered safer for humans, animals, and the environment. They help farmers protect their crops without causing harm to the soil, water, and wildlife. This study focuses on exploring how well common plants—specifically calamansi (<i>Citrus microcarpa</i>), dalandan (<i>Citrus aurantium</i>), lemongrass (<i>Cymbopogon citratus</i>), and chili (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>)—work as organic pesticides. By comparing these natural substances, the study aims to find out which combination is best for promoting the healthy growth of snap beans (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>), a widely grown vegetable in many places, including the Philippines.</p>

<p>Previous research has looked into different natural substances as alternatives to chemical pesticides. Around the world, studies have shown that citrus extracts, like those from lemon, orange, and calamansi, can effectively repel and kill various pests because of a compound called limonene found in citrus oils. For example, a study by <i>Singh and Upadhyay (2014)</i> found that citrus peel extracts significantly reduced aphid populations on treated plants. In the Philippines, local researchers have also studied calamansi and dalandan as natural insecticides, especially in small-scale farming. One such study by <i>Mendoza et al. (2019)</i> demonstrated that calamansi peel extract was effective in reducing the population of leafhoppers on rice plants. Similarly, lemongrass has been well studied for its ability to repel insects, especially mosquitoes, due to its high citronella content. <i>Jantan and Zaki (1999)</i> found that lemongrass oil provided significant protection against mosquito bites, making it a widely used natural repellent. Research on chili, especially <i>Capsicum annuum</i>, has shown that capsaicin, the compound that makes chili peppers spicy, is good at keeping pests like aphids and beetles away. A study by <i>Dubey and Misra (2021)</i> demonstrated that chili extract effectively reduced the feeding activity of aphids on treated plants. However, while these studies give us important information about how these plants work individually, there hasn’t been much research comparing their combined effects, especially in organic farming in the Philippines.</p>

<p>Even though there has been a lot of research on organic pesticides, there’s a noticeable lack of studies that compare how different combinations of natural substances like organic pesticides work on specific crops. There isn’t much research on how the combination of calamansi, dalandan, lemongrass, and chili affects the growth and health of snap beans, a vegetable that is grown a lot in the Philippines and other tropical areas. This study aims to fill this gap by looking at how these combinations of organic pesticides affect the growth, health, and pest resistance of snap bean plants in a school garden.</p>

<h2>1.2 Statement of the Problem</h2>
<p>The big question we’re trying to answer in this study is: Which group of plants, calamansi and dalandan or lemongrass and chili, works better as an organic pesticide to protect snap bean plants? There have been some studies on these plants individually, but not many people have compared them directly to see which combination is the best at keeping pests away from snap beans. By answering this question, we hope to help gardeners and farmers choose the best natural methods to protect their plants without using harmful chemicals.</p>

<h2>1.3 Hypothesis</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Primary Hypothesis:</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong> There is no significant difference in the growth rate, health, and pest resistance of snap bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) plants treated with organic pesticides made from calamansi (<i>Citrus microcarpa</i>) and dalandan (<i>Citrus aurantium</i>) compared to those treated with lemongrass (<i>Cymbopogon citratus</i>) and chili (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>).</li>
        <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> There is a significant difference in the growth rate, health, and pest resistance of snap bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) plants treated with organic pesticides made from calamansi (<i>Citrus microcarpa</i>) and dalandan (<i>Citrus aurantium</i>) compared to those treated with lemongrass (<i>Cymbopogon citratus</i>) and chili (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>).</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Secondary Hypothesis:</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong> The combination of calamansi and dalandan does not result in a more effective organic pesticide compared to the combination of lemongrass and chili in terms of pest control and plant growth improvement in snap beans.</li>
        <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> The combination of calamansi and dalandan results in a more effective organic pesticide compared to the combination of lemongrass and chili in terms of pest control and plant growth improvement in snap beans.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<h2>1.4 Definition of Terms</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Calamansi (<i>Citrus microcarpa</i>):</strong> A small, sour citrus fruit commonly used in juices and cooking, especially in the Philippines.</li>
    <li><strong>Dalandan (<i>Citrus aurantium</i>):</strong> A type of orange, also known for its slightly sour taste and its use in natural insect repellents.</li>
    <li><strong>Lemongrass (<i>Cymbopogon citratus</i>):</strong> A tall, green plant with a strong lemon scent, often used in cooking, teas, and as a natural insect repellent.</li>
    <li><strong>Chili (<i>Capsicum annuum</i>):</strong> A spicy vegetable that contains capsaicin, a compound that makes it hot and is also effective in keeping pests away.</li>
    <li><strong>Snap Bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>):</strong> A common type of bean that is widely grown for its edible green pods, also known as green beans or string beans.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.5 Significance of the Study</h2>
<p>This study is important because it could help people who grow snap beans, or other plants, find safer ways to protect their crops from pests. If we can show that one of these combinations works really well, then farmers and gardeners might start using these natural pesticides instead of chemical ones. This would be good for the environment because organic pesticides are safer for the soil, water, and wildlife. It’s also healthier for people who eat the vegetables because they won’t be exposed to harmful chemicals. Plus, natural pesticides are often cheaper and easier to find, especially in places where these plants grow naturally, like in tropical regions. By doing this study, we hope to contribute to a future where farming is more sustainable and safe for everyone.</p>

<h2>1.6 Scope and Limitations</h2>
<p>This study will focus on comparing two groups of plants, calamansi and dalandan versus lemongrass and chili, used as organic pesticides for snap bean plants. We will conduct this research in a controlled environment, meaning we will grow the plants in a way where we can carefully watch them and make sure all the conditions are the same, except for the type of pesticide we use. This helps us make a fair comparison.</p>

<p>However, there are some limitations to this study. First, we’re only looking at snap bean plants, so we don’t know if the results would be the same for other kinds of plants. Second, we’re only testing these organic pesticides in one kind of soil and under one set of conditions, so the results might be different if the plants were grown in different places or climates. Finally, this study will only focus on the short-term effects of these pesticides on snap bean growth and health. We won’t be looking at long-term effects or other factors that might affect plant growth, like the type of weather or the quality of the soil. In the future, it would be interesting to test these organic pesticides in different environments or with different types of plants.</p>
